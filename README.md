# BloodBank
This is a Blood Bank Management System. This web-based application software is an online platform for managing blood donations. This was developed by the student of CHMSC-Talisay as their Final Year Project for Negros First Provincial Blood Bank Center. This was developed using PHP and MySQL Database. The project can be managed by multiple users which are the Management (Administrator, MedTech, Recruitment Officer, and Phlebotomist) and Members/Donors. This has a pleasant user interface and multiple functions for each user role. You may also refer to this project for those who are planning to develop a Blood Bank Management System.
