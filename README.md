# BloodBank
This is a Blood Bank Management System. This web-based application software is an online platform for managing blood donations. This was developed by the student of CHMSC-Talisay as their Final Year Project for Negros First Provincial Blood Bank Center. This was developed using PHP and MySQL Database. The project can be managed by multiple users which are the Management (Administrator, MedTech, Recruitment Officer, and Phlebotomist) and Members/Donors. This has a pleasant user interface and multiple functions for each user role. You may also refer to this project for those who are planning to develop a Blood Bank Management System.
The project was developed using the following:

About the Blood Bank Management System
As I have mentioned above, this Blood Bank Management System project has multiple modules and user roles. For the Administrator, these users can access the admin panel where they can manage the important details/information that is needed in the system. They have also access to manage and view the records of the donors. The Recruitment Officers are in charge of approving the survey or exam of the registered members/donors. The MedTech user roles are in charge of recording the donor's physical exam information. The Phlebotomist are the ones who are in charge of recording the donors' blood donations. Then Donors/Members can register their membership online, view their records, book/schedule blood donation, answer surveys and manage his/her system account. This project also has a public side that contains static information about the blood bank organization.
